# Kernel Optimizations

Optimizing the kernel by implementing kernel preemption, an improved scheduling system, and an improved and parallelizable heap for our kernel.

Comparing how the optimized heap performs compared to the base implementation of the kernel through various stress tests, benchmarking these algorithms based on time and memory usage.
